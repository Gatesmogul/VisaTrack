VisaTrack - Travel Visa Requirement & Application Tracker
I. Project Overview
Potential policy shifts affecting visa regulations are impacting international tourism planning in
2025. Travelers waste hours researching visa requirements across multiple government
websites, often discovering requirements too late to obtain necessary documents, leading to
canceled trips and lost money. The complexity varies dramatically by passport country,
destination, and travel purpose.
The "VisaTrack" project simplifies the confusing world of international travel visa requirements.
Travelers struggle to determine which countries they can visit visa-free, where they need
visa-on-arrival, or where advance applications are required. Each country has different
requirements, processing times, and costs. This platform provides instant visa requirement
lookup based on traveler's passport and destination, application tracking with deadline
reminders, document checklists specific to each visa type, embassy/consulate finder with
appointment booking information, and a timeline calculator showing when to start the application
process, eliminating visa-related travel anxiety and missed opportunities.
II. Scope
The project scope involves building a comprehensive visa information database covering
passport/destination combinations, visa types (tourist, business, transit), requirements,
processing times, and costs. Users input their citizenship and travel plans to receive
personalized visa guidance. The system helps track multiple visa applications simultaneously
with reminders for document submission and deadlines. Backend handles visa requirement
rules engine, application tracking, notification scheduling, and data updates. Technical
documentation covers visa rule complexity, data source reliability, and keeping information
current. The product manager ensures accuracy is prioritized as incorrect visa information could
ruin trips.
III. Deliverables
International visa requirements research and data compilation, web platform and mobile app for
visa lookup and tracking, backend for comprehensive visa requirements database,
passport-destination matching rules engine, visa application tracking system, document
checklist generator by visa type, timeline calculator with processing time estimates, deadline
reminder and notification system, embassy/consulate directory with contact information, visa
cost estimator, recent visa policy change alerts, user trip planning integration, comprehensive
documentation with data accuracy maintenance procedures, visa application guides by country,
common rejection reasons and tips, complete multi-country trip visa planning demonstrations.
