## Trip Planner Web Site
This project includes a Trip Planner page you can use in the browser.

How to use
- Open `trip.html` to create a trip. Add destinations, entry and exit dates, select purpose.
- Click `Save Trip` to save it to localStorage. View all saved trips on `trips.html`.
- You can edit a saved trip by opening it from the list (click Open).

Notes
- Per your request I removed PWA-specific support. Files that were neutralized (you can delete them if you like) are:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `sw.js`
  - `JS/sw-register.js`
  - `ASSETS/Icons/icon-192.svg`
  - `ASSETS/Icons/icon-512.svg`

- If you later want to re-enable installable PWA support I can restore these files.
